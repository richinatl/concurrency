This isn't going to be a full project, this is a space for me to work with some new Java concepts I'm learning as I get into the more advanced features.
There are some sample classes for working with threads, along with using run, sleep, and other related methods. I was going to keep this in my local files
but decided to go ahead and push it to Github. It's convenient having most of the code I'm working with, creating, or learning from in a single location just in case
something happens to my system here. I've been going back and forth between Java and JavaScript trying to improve my understanding and use of both.
